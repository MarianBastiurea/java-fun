General Information

JDK means Java Development Kit
JVM means Java Virtual Machine
Statement is complete command to be executed
Keyword is any one of a number of reserved word, that have a predefined meaning in Java
Keywords need to be in lowercase
Variables are a way to store information in computer
Declaration Statement is used to define a variable by indicating the data type, name and eventually set a value
Expression is a coding construct, that evaluates a single value
Expression is a code segment in Right side of equals sign in assign or declaration statement
Class is a building blocks for object-oriented programming
Overflow and Underflow is a value larger or lower than maximum or minimum value of an int, double,etc.
A numeric literal that exceeds maximum value of int should have "L" as suffix.
Cannot declare variables with different data type in a single statement
If you declare multiple variables with same data type, you have to declare data types only once before any variables name
The Java compiler does not attempt to evaluate the value in a variable when it's used in a calculation, so it's
doesn't know if the value fits, and throws an error
Casting means to convert a number from one type to another
We use a floating point number when we need high precision in calculations
Double is more fast to be compiled than a float number
Char contains only one character
String is a class that contain a sequence of characters
+ is addition for numbers and concatenation for String
Immutable means you cannot change a String after is created
i++ means incrementing by 1
x-=y same with x=x-y
x*=y same x=x*y

Control Flow

The if-then statement is the most basic of all control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain
section of a code, only if a particular test evaluates to true. this is known as a Conditional Logic"
!= means not equal
&& evaluate if the both test are true
|| evaluate if one of both test are true
! logical Not operator known as Logical Complement operator
Operand1 ? Operand2 : Operand3, evaluate Operand1 if it's true will execute Operand 2and
if it's false will execute Operand3

Inheritance

a class could be described as :
    a special block code that contains methods
An object is called an instance of particular class
Class can be organized into logical groups, which are called packages
A "public class" means any other class in any package could access this class. "public" is modifier
A "class" means that class it's accessible only to classes from same package
A "private class" means no other class could access this class
A "protected class" allows classes in same package and any subclasses in other package, to have access to member
Encapsulation means:-bundling of behaviour and attributes on a single object
                    - hiding fields,and some methods, from public access
null is a special keyword in Java, meaning that the variable or attribute has a type but no reference to an object
getter is a method on a class, that retrieves the values of a private field, and returns it
setter is a method in a class, that sets the value of a private field
"this" really refers to is instance that was created when objects was instantiated
Constructor is used in the creation on a object, that's an instance of a class
it's a special type of code block that has a specific name and parameters, much like a method.
Have the same name as class but no return any values.Never include a return type from constructor, not even "void".

Constructor chaining is when a constructor explicitly call another overloaded constructor
You can call a constructor only from another constructor
Instance of a class is a new object created using that class.
